<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>Most people nowadays have an account on most social network out there. These social networks promise privacy protection to its users insuring them that their data is safe, but according to Danesh Irani “weakest privacy policies in the social network ecosystem determine how much personal information is disclosed online”
(Danesh Irani, 2011). With that said, everyday people will face exposure on the internet to their personal information. To avoid these kinds of cyber-attacks that affect the public, major companies have been working on ensuring their customers’ personal information is safe from any kind of theft.</p>

<h2> Social networking and personal information  </h2>
<p>When people join social networking sites, they begin by creating a profile, a profile is a list of personal information. People can add their friends and try tomeet others from all over the world. Profiles can have a real name, or a pseudonym. It also allows the user to put up photographs and share their personal interests.A connection between two users happens when a friend request is sent, and the other party has the option to accept or decline. The “friends” that you add can now seeand share any photographs, personal information and anything you decide to put on the social network and vice versa. In this way, people put themselves at risk onthe web and allow people that want to cause harm to take this personal information and use it to expose them.</p>

<p> A research conducted by  Zinaida Benenson from the University of	 Erlangen-Nuremberg she compared Facebook users to users that use email to see how many people would click on a  link that might be malicious .She found that one in five clicked a link from a stranger in an email, more than twice as many did so on Facebook. Show that the public need to be educated on what a malicious email looks like and what it can do (Hickey Shane, 2016). </p>

<h2> Exposure of personal information on the web  </h2>
<p>Over the years there have been hundreds of incidences regarding the security of personal information like the 2018 Facebook scandal. The Facebook–Cambridge	 Analytica data scandal was a major political scandal in May of 2018 when it was revealed Cambridge Analytica, had obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook profiles without their knowledge and used it for political purposes. It has been described as one of the worst scandals in recent memory and has brought up a discussion to the public to the understanding of personal data. As a result, Facebook stocks prices took a massive fall and investors called for tighter regulation of tech companies' use of personal data. (Salinas, 2018)( Scarsi, 2018). In addition to companies trying to obtain people's personal data, there is also cyber-attacks caused by socialbots that are created to harvest personal data as well.</p>

<p>According to researchers they have found that bots are a effective method for harvesting personal data from social network sites as proven by (Boshmaf, 2011) and (Bilge, 2009) according to multiple sources Facebook has revealed as of November 2017,it is estimated that there are over 207 million duplicate accounts and 60 million fake accounts 10% of Facebook's 2.07 billion monthly users (James Titcomb,2017)(Alex Heath, 2017). The research also shows a major amount of data leakage is actually caused by the users themselves (Mao, 2011).</p>

<h2> Cyber Security  </h2>
<p>Cyber security is defined as a technique that protects computers, networks, programs and data from unwanted access from hackers that attack steal information of other people. Cyber security is becoming more important and relevant in recent years and has become part of our daily lives. Cyber attacks are the main focus of the cyber security discourse, these attackers are called hackers. These hackers try to breach the security that’s in place to can retrieve the wanted data to cause harm. (Myriam Dunn Cavelty 2015) In reality, cyber security entails larger study areas and complex matters. To explain it, she addresses “three interlocking cyber-security discourses, which are technical discourse, crime-espionage discourse and military-civil defense discourse”. (pp. 402-408).</p>

<p>Technical disorder is the most important for the people as it affects them the most with this type of discourse that produced malware viruses that are a threat to a user’s computer As and data. It is described to be that it handle the matters of “viruses, worms, and malware” (pp. 402-408). For example, SpyEye is a piece of malicious malware that is capable of hacking into bank account information, social security numbers and financial data that is used to steal money. (Andra Zaharia 2016).</p>

  <h2> Preventing exposure of personal information  </h2>
  <p>So what can the user do? What can big companies and corporation do to mitigate and prevent malicious cyber-attacks that take aim at stealing information from innocent people to harass, blackmail and expose into the web? To start off with personal safety, a study from Clarkson University has said “the usernames in malicious login attempts that target the accounts of real users consist almost exclusively of first names”. (Owen, J.P). This shows the weakness in password and usernames being too easy for hackers to obtain and get access to the account. Additionally, users need to protect themselves by ensuring they have boundary firewalls and internet gateways. Having the right software and hardware helps protect the user to form a perimeter of defense by encrypting their data and that results in blocking malicious files, websites, unwanted downloads and informs the user of any unusual activities. </p>

  <p>On the other hand, big companies have been trying to counter, fake and scam accounts in recent years. Recently Facebook has released a report for the first time, showing how many fake accounts it's taken down in the first quarter of 2018, about 583 million fake accounts during the first three months of 2018  (Alfred, N.G., 2018). In this way, companies should enforce a password policy that will prevent new users to use easily guessed passwords and have an account lock feature that locks the account after a failed number of attempts. Additional authentication measures for access personal information should also be in place. For example, the two-factor authentication method that lets users have an extra layer of protection, this method has been implemented in recent years though out social media platforms and other websites.</p>

  <h2> Conclusion  </h2>
  <p>In the last 2 years humans have produced more data than in all human history proceeding it, to start mitigating the number of cyber attacks and online theft that happen too often change must start with big tech companies managing their customers information, additionally the user must be prepared for any kind of personal information exposure by being informed and doing the necessary procedure that are mentioned above to be prepared for the worst.  </p>
