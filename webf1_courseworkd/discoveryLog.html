<h2> Week 1 - Welcome to Web Foundations 1</h2>
For the first week of the course we were introduced to the virtual machine, which we will be using for the remainder of the course. We started working with it immediately by starting our own server within it and completing the worksheet that was given to us. After completing the VM worksheet, we started working in pairs on a worksheet called “Website Awards” the aim of this question and answer task was to see what kind of websites we find useful, helpful and enjoy visiting and what we don’t find that interesting or confusing.

Starting off we put up the three categories “Secret”, “Sensitive” and “Public”, the discussion then started, talking about what kind of data does each of us produce on a daily basis and we found that we had quite a few similar data types that we shared.

We got to learn all types of strategies to complete this task. First off we got some tips on how to start, by thinking about the topic and what kind of subjects are involved in it we were able to write up notes that will guide us through the rest of the coursework. After that, we get some search terms from our notes and start searching through the internet for reliable,trusted and honest sources that will help gather up information to write in our notes, by reapeating this proceess multiple times we should be able to write our Literature review.

<h2> Week 4 - Academic Writing</h2>
 In week 4 we discuss the effects of what are the type of words that are appropriate and how can it affect our literature review in making the reader understand our literature better.By avoiding personal,emotive tones, exclaiming, unqualified statements,informality,contractions and many more to make our literature more. In that weeks practical we did exercises based on changing different words to make the statment more understandable and up to standard. Moving on to referencing we learnt the correct way to reference our sources by using APAv6 and applaying it to every resourse that we use in our literature.

<h2> Week 5 - Introduction to Markup</h2>
 In weeek 5 we begin learning Markup languages & HTML by using our VM machines to create a basic website and viewing the page in a browser directly from the cloud. After creating the website we use 4 steps to get it running and be able to view it. First we start up our <h3>VM machine and WinSCP to upload the file in them, coping the IP address provided by the VM to the SCP to connect</h3> After that we open up the VM and connect the folder by using <h3>"cd (name of folder)"</h3> and runnning the web page by wrtting <h3>"http-server"</h3>

<h2> Week 9 - Design</h2>
We were given the task of putting pieces of paper mentioning what a resort holiday can offer into different categories that describes them best. After we did that we looked around the room and saw the other groups answers and we compared them with ours. We noticed that we had similar categories names and for the most part we agreed on a lot of terms that describe each word. The point of this was that to show that information has to be organized and easy to access in a website for examples, so that the user can have an easy time getting the information that he/she is looking for.

Images are defined using an <code>IMG</code> element.  This comprises a <em>tag</em> along with <code>src</code> and <code>alt</code> attributes.
 <h3>How to insert an image example :</h3> &lt;img src=example.png alt = "the name of the image."&gt;

<h3> Linking an image:</h3>
To turn any image into a link, wrap it in an anchor element (i.e. <code>&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;img src="" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>)

<h2> Week 13 - Addressing the Web </h2>
<p> In week 13 we analyzed links and how to implement them. The URL can be a full one as specified in previous slides, e.g.
&lt;a href="http://www.port.ac.uk/">University of Portsmouth&lt;/a &gt;
 </p>

 <p>
 Also we learnt how to create a list of links and naming them to indicate what the link is. Steps
</p>

<p>
1. Add three more pairs of &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; tags to the extlinks &lt;ul&gt; in index.html, each on a new line. You should now have four empty list items.
</p>

<p>
2. Between each pair of &lt;li&gt; &lt;/li&gt; tags, add an &lt;a&gt; tag to link to your chosen websites. You should then have a link for each item in the bullet list, like the one shown at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<p>
3. Check that the links work

<h2> Week 14 - Website Marking Scheme </h2>
<p>In week 14 we focused on validation, more specificly validating html and css code. Using the w3validator it points out errors within the code and helps us to keep our code up to par and free of any syntax errors. We also discussed the criterias for the website, that we are going to use to mark our peers and give them feedback on there website.</p>

 During the practical I used the validator to validate my code that I have written so far on my website. I also want to implement a validation link in my website so show that my code is free of any errors and also because its specified on the criterias.
